# About
A coding challenge that should be done in 7 days. Had to make it in 3,5 ~ 4 days, over half of it in a single weekend, since I wasn't able to start the challenge when it was sent. The goal was not to finish it perfectly, but to give a grasp of the coding style and how things are done.

Get the files on your pc and, when inside that folder, use the following commands:

```yarn```

```yarn serve```

The first command, "yarn", will install everything needed. After that, "yarn serve" will start everything up using the vue cli 3 service. After everything is compiled successfully, open your browser and access the localhost url (http://localhost:8080)

Make sure you have both [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed before using these.

The project is live at [https://adoring-pasteur-698913.netlify.com/](https://adoring-pasteur-698913.netlify.com/)

# Considerations

- Decided to use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) as both are amazing tools.

- Lack of time completely cut down any kind of unit testing.

- Fun challenge but I'm sure I would feel and perform better if it wasn't for the time constraint.
